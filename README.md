# Task 4 – Windows Firewall Configuration – Cyber Security Internship

## 🔒 Objective
To learn how to block and allow specific ports using the Windows Firewall, and understand how traffic filtering works.

---

## ⚙️ What Was Done

- Blocked inbound traffic on port **23** (Telnet)
- Allowed connection on port **3389** (RDP)
- Deleted the test firewall rule

## 💬 Interview Questions & Answers

**1. What is a firewall?**  
A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined rules.

**2. Difference between stateful and stateless firewall?**  
- *Stateful*: Keeps track of the state of active connections  
- *Stateless*: Treats each packet independently

**3. What are inbound and outbound rules?**  
- *Inbound*: Controls traffic entering your system  
- *Outbound*: Controls traffic leaving your system

**4. Why block port 23 (Telnet)?**  
Because Telnet is an old protocol that sends data in plain text, making it insecure.

**5. What is NAT in firewalls?**  
NAT (Network Address Translation) converts private IPs into public IPs, hiding internal systems.

**6. Common firewall mistakes?**  
- Leaving insecure ports open  
- Misconfigured rules  
- No logging or alerting
